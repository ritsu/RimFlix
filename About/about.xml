    <description>Create shows from custom images and play them on television screens.

Players:
• Display images and photos from your computer on your RimWorld televisions!
• Adjust timings to create smooth animations or simple slideshows.
• Manually control which shows play, or allow  pawns to change shows themselves.
• Play shows continuously or only when pawns are watching.
• Optionally adjust power consumption of TVs when being watched vs. idle.

Artists and Animators:
• Create and share shows with the RimWorld community!
• No coding required. Just create your images and XML file, then upload to Steam Workshop.
• See https://github.com/ritsu/RimFlix-Anime-Loops for an exmaple.
